  The goal of this assignment is to answer the question below :

A long answer is finding the features and then use feature selecting
mechanism to rectify the variant features to match from. This leads us
to a question of “how do we find the features? This is indeed the first
task of our assignment. Implementing Harris Corner Detector, Harris
corner is nothing but a detector of a junction of two edges. This
junction is called corner. An edge is basically a sudden change in
brightness of the image. As we want features to be invariant when we
change the angle of capturing a same view. Corner does that for us.
Generally, corner is considered as a feature point invariant to
illumination, translation, and rotation in an image. But the role of
corner becomes hard to understand for a changing scale. A corner for an
image at one scale can be an edge for the same image at different scale
(lower scale). SIFT comes into ground to solve this problem. The theory
is finding the features from a different scale space may change the view
of features. Given an image one can find Difference of Gaussian (DoG)
from a scaled version of the image. It is approximately same as finding
the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), a computationally expensive algorithm.
Then a search is performed in pyramid scale space to look for extrema,
either maxima or minima. The next step is keypoint localization and
assigning orientation. The last step in finding features is to generate
a keypoint descriptor which has 128 bins representing a 16\*16
neighbourhood. Matching comes after we have extracted features. These
features are matched based on nearest neighbour algorithm. The ratio of
closest to second closet feature is taken and threshold is set to
eliminate the false positives. Before diving deep into the
implementation, I have list down the key component of this assignment:

### Step I: Interest point detection

   This implementation is based on “Harris” corner detector. The main
theme is to find the horizontal and vertical derivative of an image and
build a correlation matrix. In this project I firstly used sobel
operator to find x and y derivate. One important thing is to remember
that we are considering a gray scale image only. Once we have x and y
derivative, we find the correlation matrix. The correlational matrix has
square of x/y derivatives on diagonal axis whereas the off diagonal
entries are product of x and y gradient. In the next step we generate a
gaussian kernel of size 5 and sigma 1. According to **Szeliski 4.1.1**
the algorithm to extract the intrest points can be listed as:

<!-- -->

    Intrest point detection using Harris Corner detector
    #This routine finds the local maxima using Correlation matrix

        alpha = 0.04 # tuning parameter for later stage
       

        m, n = img.shape #finding the shape of image (image is grayscale)

        # finding X and Y derivative using Sobel 
        Iy = cv2.Sobel(img,cv2.CV_64F,0,1,ksize=3)     # changes in Y direction
        Ix = cv2.Sobel(img, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3) # changes in X direction


        # computing auto-correaltion matrix entries, REMEMBER this matrix is symetric around off-diagonal enteries, 
        # It means I_XY =I_YX
        
        
        Iyy = Iy * Iy
        Ixx = Ix * Ix
        Ixy = Ix * Iy
        

        # convolve each entry with a guassian blurr
        gaussian_kernel = cv2.getGaussianKernel(ksize=5, sigma=1)# gaussain kernel of size 5
        Iyy = cv2.filter2D(Iyy, cv2.CV_64F, gaussian_kernel)
        Ixy = cv2.filter2D(Ixy, cv2.CV_64F, gaussian_kernel)
        Ixx = cv2.filter2D(Ixx, cv2.CV_64F, gaussian_kernel)
        
        

        # compute R strength which is nothing but the det(A)-alpha* trace(A) where alpha is choosen to be 0.04
        R_strength = (Iyy*Ixx-Ixy**2) - alpha*(Iyy+Ixx)**2 

        # threshold R with 2% of maximum value in R and disgarding those value 
        
        R_strength[R_strength<0.02*np.amax(R_strength)] = 0
        R_rect = np.copy(R_strength)

        R = []
        m, n = R_rect.shape
        Rmax = np.amax(R_rect) # finding maximum value of intrest points vector
        for y in range(0, m):
            for x in range(0, n):
                if not R_rect[y, x] == 0: #ignoring the zero values
                    R.append([int(x), int(y), 255 * R_rect[y, x] / Rmax]) # list R containing x,y position 
                                          # with normalize R feature.

   In the above routine we implemented the algorithm described above the
routine. The design parameters are alpha and the threshold we can choose
to maximize the results. Alpha value is chosen to be the 0.04 whereas
the threshold is set at 2% of the maximum value of strength matrix R.
The below figures are the results of this step. The above routine
returns a matrix R which has normalize intrest points with respective x
and y coordinates.

Fig 2: intrest point detected using Harris Corner detector, the yellow
rectangles show high contrast area.

   One can see there are more intrest points where the image contrast is
high, highlighted using yellow rectangles. In the next step the goal to
select the evenly distributed intrest points.

   Previously we just look for maxima. As we have already seen that the
number of maxima are more in high contrast region as compared to low
contrast area. This leads to uneven distribution of intrest points. To
get evenly distributed intrest points we will take a step forward
towards **Adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS)**. This method is only
to detect the intrest points that are local maximum and shows more
response compared to the neighbours within a given radius. The routine
for this step is given below:

    Adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS)

        # sort R by R_rect in descending order
        R = np.asarray(R)# Converting list to numpy array
        R = R[R[:, 2].argsort()] #indirect sorting based on feature values
        R = np.flipud(R) #upside down flippling of R

        numPts = 2000
        radiis = []

        # go through R_rect
        for i, point in enumerate(R): # i is index and point has point with x,y coordinates, and faeture value  
            if i == 0:
                radius = 9999999.0  # arbitrary large number 
                thisPtSet = (point[0], point[1], radius)
                radiis.append(thisPtSet)
                continue

            # these are key R intrest points vectors to be compared with "point"
            otherPoints = R[0:i, :] # from 0 intrest point to i-1 intrest points

            # compute the distance between the current point and all other point
            distances = np.sqrt(((otherPoints[:, 0] - point[0]) ** 2 + (otherPoints[:, 1] - point[1]) ** 2)) 
            # the above distance is eucilidean distance 
            # get the minimum distance
            
            min_dist = np.min(distances) # above all the distance find points with smallest distance

            # get the index of the keypoint with min radius
            thisPtSet = (point[0], point[1], min_dist)
        
            radiis.append(thisPtSet)

        # sort radiis in descending order
        radiis = np.asarray(radiis)#converting to numpy array
        radiis = radiis[radiis[:, 2].argsort()]#indirect sorting based on last column 
        radiis = np.flipud(radiis)#upside down flippling of raddiis

        #print(radiis.shape)
        radiis = radiis[0:numPts, :] #Selected first 2000 points

        y = radiis[:, 1]
        x = radiis[:, 0]
        

  The above routine uses Euclidean distance to select the interest point
evenly. The figure below show newly selected intrest points

![](../results/afteradap1.png) ![](../results/afteradap2.png)

Fig 3: intrest point detected after ANMS.

  Comparing Figure 2 and 3 we can see that there is less saturation of
interest points in the area with high saturation and interest points are
more evenly spreaded as compared to simple corner detector. Now that we
have our final distinct interest points the next step is to find
features.

### Step II: Local feature description

  Now in the next step we will traverse through all the interest point
obtained by the Harris algorithm. We will extract a patch of 16x16
pixels centered on the coordinates of the corner point, for each patch,
we will make 4x4 window (in total 16 small 4x4 patches). For each of the
patch we will calculate size and direction of each pixel. The next step
is calculating histogram bins. For each window our task is to make
histogram with angles as x coordinate. Each histogram has 8 bins
representing 45 degrees each. The amplitude of the histogram represents
the weighted sum of all the pixels in the given window and direction.
The code routine below will do the required job:

   The above routine will result in feature vectors of (n,128) shape
where n represent the maximum number of features selected. Once we have
the feature vector we need to match these features with features from
other image.

### Step III: Feature Matching

   We can do that by finding the distance between the features. If the
distance is small, we can say it is a match, but there can be
possibility where there is more than one similarity is found. To tackle
this problem the ratio of two nearest neighbours is considered. If the
ratio is greater than a threshold (set to be 80 percent) the points are
not considered. For distance computation we use euclidean distance as a
measure. This process is done for each feature of the image 1 with
respect to image 2. The ratio mechanism looks complex, but it is not
that tricky. One can start from sorting the distance computed for image
1 in ascending order. Then take first two smallest distance and find the
ratio. If the ratio is greater than 0.8, reject that match. The below
code routine serves the purpose.

images.

   The figure above show the location of the features and the lines
represent the corresponding matches. In the next section I will discuss
result and the changes one can do to improve the resutls.

### Results and disscussion

  I perform the experiments as per the sequence given in the notebook
and save the visual results in result folder. Even though it is
simplified version of SIFT but still perform reasonablly. In the figure
below I have attached some final results from other image examples.

   As evident from the figures above, visually it is difficult to
analyze what is right and what is wrong I therefor attach table to
analyze the results through accuracy mettric.

  One can see the table show promising result. This algorithm provides
best performance for Mount Rushmore image with only nine mistakes out of
hundred. On the contrary this algorithm suffers badly for Episcopal
Gaudi image. There are ways one can improve these results. One way is
using features from a scale space but not just from one scale. Also,
“Harris” corner detector is not exceptionally good way of detecting
corners using Maximum Stable External Area (MSER) may improve the
results.

### Conclusion

  In this assignment the goal was to understand image using features.
The features should be distinctive and should be unique. I did not focus
on scale variance. The selected features are not scale invariant which
is easily achievable if one can implement the difference of gaussian
space. From this work I learned that images have distinctive location
which are unique even the angel of capturing image changes. In term of
application one can think of building an image recognition mechanism
built on top of these feature extractor.
